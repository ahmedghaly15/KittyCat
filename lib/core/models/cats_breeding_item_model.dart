hide-and-seek games

These games are important for the health of cats, as they make them satisfy their instinctive energy to pounce on prey. Cats in the wild usually hide for their prey and then surprise it very quickly.

Cats enjoy hiding, then appearing and pouncing on your feet or on any prey-like game.
This game requires some caution. Dress up in something that will protect your hands and feet from accidental scratching, this game is fun and cats can get overly excited.

Mock Bird Games
Usually in these games, the cat breeder waves a large feather or a doll in the shape of a bird.
Cats quickly when these toys and start jumping high trying to catch the bird.
You must play with her in a wide place, free of things that could be harmed by the successive jumping of your pet, as cats become very integrated with these games.

Kicking and catching games
Cats love these games because they show their instinctive ability to hunt prey and control it after it has been eliminated. There is no doubt that you have seen your cat one day holding her favorite doll between her fangs and then kicking her hard with her hands or hind feet. These games do not require more than a small and lightweight doll in order to control them well, and it is good for a doll that contains feathers or artificial fur that resembles a small rabbit or bird. Just throw the doll in front of her so she can see her and she'll jump at her and start kicking and pouncing on her.

attack games
These games make cats develop their attacking movements on objects that walk on the ground, and they also make them look smarter.

        """Cats, like other animals, long ago lived in the wild, a life characterized by an aggressive, instinctive nature. Man came and domesticated them and made them pets. Thus, cats have become human companions in life, sharing life with him under one roof, and problems such as biting may appear from time to time, and you can overcome and treat them, just be patient.

Diagnosing the problem:
Some cats, when they are hungry, become violent (Aggressive).
The problem gets worse if you provide it with food while it is in this state, so that the cat believes that this is the ideal way to request food, and therefore expects to repeat this matter in the future.

the solution :
If you see your cat hungry and start doing aggressive actions like biting or scratching furniture with nails, let her calm down and don't hit her. Leave her until she calms down, then give her food, and if she hurts you during the process of serving food, stop the process for a while, then look at her from afar and say the word no in a loud voice.
I leave her until she calms down again, and believe me, the method is effective and works for almost all cats.

Also, playing with cats treats many cases of depression. And this is not all, cats also learn to wake up early, and this is because cats, when their breakfast time arrives, will not let you sleep, my friend, and will inevitably wake you up, and on the other hand, raising cats requires you to know these things.

The first thing :
Most cats, after reaching the age of six months, ask for mating, and this means that the cat makes sounds and makes strange movements constantly, until it gets married or calms down, and this is necessary for you to know before you are surprised about the matter after raising it, because unfortunately many people abandon it thinking that it is bewitched or sick.

Third thing:
Bones are forbidden because they affect their teeth, and cats' teeth are not equipped to crush bones like dogs or other animals.

The last thing we want to tell you is that cats have a weak immunity against diseases, so we must strengthen them through the vaccine or what is called in most Arab countries vaccination.""",

        """Adult cats spend about 50 percent of their waking time licking themselves, and more often than not the cats lick each other. Pet cats may lick or suckle at your clothes, too. In general, this behavior is one of the methods by which cats show their affection, just like a mother cat when she licks her young, she is very attracted to you and feels belonging to you.

Why does the cat lick its owner?
She licks her owner because she considers him a member of her family and wants to distinguish him with her scent so that other cats do not approach him, just as she scratches some places to show her control over her, as she licks your face or limbs because she owns you, and of course if your pet friend licks your hair after a shower or your hands after eating a meal food.
It could simply be that he's attracted to the smell of your shampoo or the food you've eaten.
If the cat is suckling or licking you excessively, this may be due to the fact that she lived as an orphan or was weaned from her mother early.
Experts believe that kittens that were removed from their mother early may continue with the behavior of children throughout their lives, however, licking or nursing can be a response to anxiety and stress, or it may be just a comforting behavior for cats.""",
